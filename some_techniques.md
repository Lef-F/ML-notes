# Some Techniques

## Lag

Introduce delay into the data by ´´n´´ steps. 
Usually to prepare the data set in such a way that the model learns to predict ´´n´´ steps in the future.

## Dif

With ´´Dif´´ (or ´´Diff´´) we calculate the difference from the previous values of the ´´Lag´´ that we have introduced.
